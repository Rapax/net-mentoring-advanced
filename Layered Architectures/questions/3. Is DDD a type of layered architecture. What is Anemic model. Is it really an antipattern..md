DDD is not a type of layered architecture. It is a design approach that can be used in combination with layered architecture or other architectural patterns. DDD emphasizes a focus on the domain model and its representation within the software system, as well as a shared understanding of the domain between stakeholders.

An Anemic model is an anti-pattern where the domain model is defined with only data structures and business logic is defined in separate classes or modules. The Anemic model pattern typically results in an anemic domain model, which lacks behavior and encapsulation and leads to a proliferation of data structures and a decrease in maintainability.

Whether the anemic model is an antipattern or not depends on the context of its usage. There are situations where anemic models can be useful, such as in simple CRUD applications where the business logic is straightforward and there is no need for complex domain models. However, in more complex applications, using an anemic model can lead to several issues, including:

1.  Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): If behavior is separated from the data, it can lead to a violation of SRP. The code may become more difficult to maintain, and changes to one part of the code can affect the behavior of other parts.
    
2.  Poor Encapsulation: Anemic models can lead to poor encapsulation, as the behavior is often implemented outside of the domain model. This can lead to coupling between the data and the behavior, making it difficult to change one without affecting the other.
    
3.  Code Duplication: If behavior is implemented outside of the domain model, it can lead to code duplication, as the same behavior may need to be implemented in multiple places.
    

Therefore, in most cases, it is advisable to avoid using anemic models and instead use domain-driven design principles to create rich domain models that encapsulate both data and behavior.
