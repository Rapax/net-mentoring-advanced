It looks the architecture is incorrect by the next reasosns: 

In a layered architecture, each layer represents a specific level of abstraction and provides a set of services or functionality to the layer above it. The layers are organized in a way that higher-level layers cannot call or access lower-level layers directly it can be done using well defined interfaces.

In a layered architecture lower-level layers couldn't call higher level layers. It is a general approach. The reason for this is to enforce modularity, separation of concerns, and maintainability of the system. If a higher-level layer were allowed to access lower-level layers directly or vice versa, it would create tight coupling between the layers and increase the complexity of the system.

This would make it difficult to modify or extend the system in the future without introducing unintended side effects, as any changes made to a lower-level layer could potentially affect the behavior of higher-level layers.

In good layered architecture it is impossible use B from C or C from A.

The layered architecture promotes loose coupling, separation of concerns, and modularity, which make the system more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
