**Testability** refers to the degree to which a software application or system can be tested effectively and efficiently. It is a measure of how easy it is to create and run tests for the system, as well as how easily defects can be identified and fixed. A system with good testability is typically easier to maintain, as it allows for quicker identification and resolution of issues.
**Extensibility** refers to the ability of a software application or system to be extended or enhanced easily with new features or functionality. It is a measure of how flexible the system is and how easily it can accommodate changes and new requirements. A system with good extensibility is typically more adaptable and future-proof, as it can be modified and extended to meet changing needs without requiring major restructuring or reengineering.
**Scalability** refers to the ability of a software application or system to handle growing amounts of work or traffic without diminishing performance. It is a measure of how well the system can accommodate increased demands while maintaining its efficiency, reliability, and availability.

To ensure Testability, Extensibility, and Scalability in software development, developers should follow best practices and techniques such as unit testing, modular design, abstraction, caching, and performance optimization. By incorporating these practices into the development process, software applications can be built with a focus on quality, flexibility, and scalability.

Yes, Clean Architecture is designed to address these requirements, by providing a set of guidelines and best practices for designing software systems that are easy to test, maintain, and extend.
