Architectural anti-patterns are common design or implementation practices in software development that lead to suboptimal or negative outcomes, including reduced maintainability, scalability, and reliability. Here are three examples of architectural anti-patterns:

1. God Object: It is an anti-pattern where a single object or class contains all of the application's logic and data. This anti-pattern violates the Single Responsibility Principle and leads to code that is difficult to maintain and modify. In a recent project, I faced issues with a God Object that was responsible for performing multiple tasks, including authentication, authorization, and data storage. I had to refactor the code to break the responsibilities into smaller, more focused objects.
2. Spaghetti code: It is an anti-pattern and term used to describe code that is overly complex and tangled, making it difficult to understand and maintain. This anti-pattern can occur due to various reasons, such as rushed development cycles or a lack of adherence to coding standards. To avoid spaghetti code, developers should follow best practices such as using meaningful variable and function names, keeping functions short and focused, and avoiding deeply nested loops. Refactoring code regularly and following coding standards and guidelines can also help avoid spaghetti code.
3. Magic number: It is a coding issue where literal values or constants are used directly in the code without explanation or context. This makes the code difficult to understand and maintain. To avoid this issue, developers should declare constants or variables with meaningful names that explain their purpose, making the code more readable and understandable.
