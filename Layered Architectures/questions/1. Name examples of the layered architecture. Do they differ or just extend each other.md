1.  Three-Tier Architecture:  used in software development that separates the presentation, business logic, and data storage into separate layers.
2. Clean Architecture/Onion/Hexagonal: Is a layered architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of components, making the codebase easier to maintain and modify.
3.  MVC Architecture: Model-View-Controller is a three-layer architecture mostly used in web application development.
	1. MVVM is a variation of MVC. It can be considered as a layered architecture pattern. Mostly used in desktop and mobile applications.
4. TCP/IP Model: The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a four-layer model for computer network architecture.

MVC, Three-Tier and Clean Architecture share some similarities, they are not just extensions of each other. While they have some overlapping principles, they differ in their overall approach to software design and the specific strategies they use to achieve their goals. It is important to choose the appropriate architecture pattern based on the specific requirements and constraints of the application being developed.
