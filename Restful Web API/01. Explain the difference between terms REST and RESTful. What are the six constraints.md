REST (Representational State Transfer) and RESTful are often used interchangeably, but they actually have distinct meanings.

REST is a design architecture that outlines a set of architectural constraints to design web services in a standardized way. RESTful, on the other hand, refers to the implementation of those design principles in web services or APIs.

The six constraints of REST are:

1.  Client-server architecture: The client and server should be separated, allowing them to evolve independently and enabling scalability.
    
2.  Stateless: The server should not store any client context between requests. Each request should contain all the necessary information for the server to understand and fulfill it.
    
3.  Cacheability: Responses should be cacheable, so that clients can reuse them if they have the same request again in the future.
    
4.  Uniform interface: A uniform interface should be used to simplify and decouple the architecture. This constraint is further broken down into four sub-constraints: 
	-   Resource identification: Resources should be identified in requests, using URIs or URNs.
	-   Resource manipulation through representations: Resources should be represented in a standardized way, such as JSON or XML, and should be able to be manipulated through that representation.
	-   Self-descriptive messages: Requests and responses should include enough information for the recipient to understand them, including metadata like content-type and cacheability information.
	-   Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS): The server should provide links to related resources to guide the client's next actions.

5.  Layered system: A layered system allows intermediaries, such as proxies, gateways, and firewalls, to be inserted between the client and server, improving scalability, security, and flexibility.
    
6.  Code on demand (optional): Servers can optionally provide executable code to the client, such as JavaScript, to be executed on the client-side. This constraint is optional because it is not always practical or desirable to execute code on the client-side.
    

By adhering to these six constraints, developers can create web services that are scalable, flexible, and easy to understand and use.
