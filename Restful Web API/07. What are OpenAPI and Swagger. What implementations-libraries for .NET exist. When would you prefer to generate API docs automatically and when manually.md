OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs that provides a standardized way of describing RESTful APIs. It allows developers to generate documentation, SDKs, and other tools automatically from API descriptions. Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI specification that enables developers to design, build, document, and consume RESTful APIs. Swagger includes tools such as the Swagger Editor for designing APIs, the Swagger UI for documentation and testing, and Swagger Codegen for generating client libraries.

There are several implementations and libraries for .NET that can be used with OpenAPI and Swagger, including:

1.  Swashbuckle: This is a popular library for .NET that provides automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation for ASP.NET Core APIs. It includes tools such as the Swagger UI for testing and visualizing the API documentation.
    
2.  NSwag: This is another popular library for .NET that provides code generation, OpenAPI documentation generation, and other features. It can be used with ASP.NET Core, Web API, and other .NET frameworks.
    
3.  RestSharp: This is a popular REST client library for .NET that supports Swagger documentation and other features.
    

Whether to generate API documentation automatically or manually depends on the specific requirements of the project. Automatically generated documentation can be helpful for getting started quickly and ensuring consistency, but it may not capture all the nuances of the API. On the other hand, manually written documentation can provide more detail and context, but it can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In general, a combination of both approaches may be the best solution, where automatic documentation is used as a starting point and manually edited and expanded as needed.
